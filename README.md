# Tally
### Team T1

**Deployment:** [tally-5ug5.vercel.app](https://tally-5ug5.vercel.app)

As students at Tufts University, many of us are involved in extracurriculars that require submitting reimbursement forms. While this is a great resource for our clubs, the process has unfortunately been poorly executed. So... we built Tally to streamline reimbursements and make both TCU and club members happier (hopefully)!
